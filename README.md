# Hi there üëã, my name is Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·∫∑ng T·∫•n H∆∞ng
I'm Developer from **CodeLyoko Teams**. I was born in B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province.

**Code Lyoko** is a French animated television series that premiered in 2003. The show follows a group of teenagers who discover a virtual world called Lyoko, which is inhabited by a malevolent entity known as XANA. This is a movie that I have liked since I was young, so I named my team after this movie.
